Mutual Exclusion Protocol
=========================

This case study is taken from the <a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/casestudies/rabin.php" target="_blank">PRISM website</a> and it is based on Rabin's solution to the well known mutual exclusion problem, where n processes from time to time need to execute a critical section in which exactly one of them is allowed to employ a shared resource. The processes can coordinate their activities by use of a common resource.
