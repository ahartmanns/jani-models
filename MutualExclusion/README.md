=========================

This case study is taken from the <a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/casestudies/mutual.php" target="_blank">PRISM website</a> and it is based on Pnueli and Zuck's probabilistic symmetric solution to the n-process mutual exclusion problem. The model is represented as an MDP.
